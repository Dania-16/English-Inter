    <h3>Do you know the steps you need to take for writing an essay?</h3>
<p> First of all you should have an idea of the assignment, since writing an essay is not just anything. In the first instance, consider the topic you are going to investigate and you should know that there are different types of essays, so the structure varies. In this section you will know how to elaborate an essay applying characteristics that include any type of these.

    <h3>What's an essay?</h3>

      It is often considered synonymous with a story or a paper or an article. Essays can be formal as well as informal. Formal essays are generally academic in nature and tackle serious topics. "Writing an academic essay means fashioning a coherent set of ideas into an argument. Because essays are essentially linear—they offer one idea at a time—they must present their ideas in the order that makes most sense to a reader. Successfully structuring an essay means attending to a reader's logic." (Harvard university).
</p>There are seven things to consider before writing your essay: sender, receiver, message, channel, code, referent and context. Of these, the most important by far is your thesis, or the crux of what your essay is about.
<p>Here's the explanation for each of the elements.</p>
</article>

</div>

</article>
<br>
<br>
<article class="sectionelements">
<ul>
<li>Issuer/Sender: That person who will be in charge of writing the text considering its subject of which it will deal. In addition, it is said that each one has a different style to write what you want to transmit or expose. </li>
<br>
<li>Receiver: Person who reads the essay when interested in that topic that is exposed, so that, depending on the type it is, it will be given an interpretation (subjective mode), for example if an essay was written on a play, or if an opinion or a text of reflection and critical part of a current event were included.</li>
<BR>
<li>Message: This is the object of the communication. The Message contains the information that the Sender sends to the Receiver through a certain Channel or means of communication</li>

</ul>
</article>

<article class="sectionelements2">
<ul>
<li>Channel: Means by which the writing will be transmitted can be through a magazine, and can even be written to be recited. (Written or oral medium).</li>
<br>
<li> Code: Refers to the language that will be used to write. There are even essays that use two languages as in the case of academics where the summaries of the content are presented in different languages or the keywords to be used.  </li>
<li>Referent: it is the real object to which the message of the communication refers and that is perceived by the receiver when decoding the message he receives from the sender. It is the theme around which the communicative process is elaborated.</li>
<br>
<li>Context: it is the environment that surrounds the communicative situation, the extralinguistic situation that surrounds the message. The situational context can be political, social, historical, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to follow in order to write a good essay</h3>
<h2>Step number 1:</h2>
<p>First of all you should have a topic to write about it, as well as an idea of what it is or at least a general idea. After having a topic in mind, (consider that you are now committed to getting it right). make a list of the points you want to address or that are relevant so that you can include them in the essay. You can group the ideas based on how similar they are. so that you can form subtopics to address.</p>

<h2>Step number 2:</h2>
<p>Look for information on the subject, however, you must be careful when selecting information since remember that anyone can upload information to the web that is not true. Therefore, we recommend that you search PDF documents belonging to educational or international institutions. Remembering that the bibliography consulted must present characteristics such as: authorship, recent dates etc. Also, consider keywords from your research this will facilitate the search for what will make up your text.</p>

<h2>Step number 3:</h2>
<p>After you have read the selected sources, it is time to write an introduction, do not forget the format they ask you. In this first part of the text you can mention something that catches the reader, that is, mention a curious fact, make an analogy etc. Subsequently, an entry is given of what will be found in the text, that is, the theme, also indicating the purpose of the writing (to entertain, expose, to create awareness about something) and what is achieved from it.</p>

<h2>Step number 4:</h2>
<P>Start writing the corresponding subtopics based on the articles read. Here the connectors must be handled in order to generate the textual properties (coherence, adequacy, cohesion). That is, it is about adapting the text based on the audience to which it will be focused. And you should not forget to quote the authors of the other documents in case of paraphrasing and textual quotations, where after these it is recommended to make an analysis.</P>

<h2>Step number 5:</h2>
<p>Write on a piece of paper what has been learned with the development of the topic. And think about whether the topic can help generate reflection on something that is happening in the current context. Sort the ideas and pass them to the document. To finish, you should be given a grammar, spelling and punctuation check.</p>

<h3>Now let's write a resumé</h3>
<p>Fist of all... What is a resumé?A resume is a brief document that highlights an individual's experience, qualifications, and skills, in the hopes of securing a job interview. In some regions of the world, the term is used interchangeably with Curriculum Vitae (CV), while in other places, the two terms refer to very different documents. A resume is a summary of your knowledge, experience, and qualifications that will allow the recruiter to make a decision. </p>
