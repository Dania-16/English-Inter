          <h5 class="card-title"> Simulation of job interviews</h5>
          <p class="card-text"> In the United States, each company has its own set of guidelines on how to determine if a candidate is the right fit for the job. A company’s guidelines will assess whether you have the knowledge and skills necessary for the job, and also ensure that you fit well into the company culture.

            In most cases, a typical American job interview process has two steps, a first and second interview. However, for some positions that require a more specialized skill set, your interview could go beyond this standard two-step process and include practical tests of your knowledge and skills. Keep in mind that the interview process could vary depending on the company and industry. 
            Interviewing for a job can be stressful, no matter the circumstances. Interviewing for a job in a different country, with a different language and culture from what you are used to, can be downright overwhelming. However, remaining calm, confident, and friendly during your interview can improve your performance tremendously.

            When answering questions, be sure to smile, and feel free to take a moment to think before answering the question. If water is offered to you before the interview, accept it. Taking a sip of water before answering a question could provide you with some time to think through your response.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Revision of documents</h5>
          <p class="card-text"> Proofreading means examining your (yet to be finally printed) text carefully to find and correct typographical and grammatical errors. Proof-reading your document shows people that you take pride in your work and are serious about what you publish. Before finalizing an academic research paper, essay or any other form of written document, it is very important for a writer to always go over what they have written so as not to publish a document that is full of mistakes (as only an unprofessional writer would be careless enough to do so). Your writing is a reflection of yourself and will be the first impression you implant on people who haven’t met you. We need to invest as much care and thought in our writing as we do in our speech and clothes. It is extremely important to proof read your paper because errors in written works cause misunderstanding; the intent and meaning of the written word being changed can cause damage to the writer’s reputation. </p>
