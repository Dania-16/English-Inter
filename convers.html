        <h2> Job Interview</h2>
        <br>
    <p>
      Mss. Crow: Hello Ms. Brown, I’m Kristina Crow. Thanks so much for coming in. <br>
      Ms. Brown: It’s my pleasure, thanks for meeting with me.<br>
      Mss. Crow: Of course. Did you have any trouble by scheduling the appointment or finding this office. <br>
      Ms. Brown: Just a bit by scheduling but I could solve it. And the directions given for the office were clear. Thanks for asking.<br>
      Mss. Crow: Ok, so let’s get started. Why don’t you tell me something about yourself, I refer to working experience or your history in the area you studied. <br>
      Ms. Brown: I graduated from the chemical engineering career of the University of Cambridge, and I have worked in companies such as Nestlé, Coca Cola, occupying positions of line supervisor and quality mainly. I think they always choose me in those areas because of my great capacity for reflection and analysis. However, I am looking for a position higher than what I have been assigned in previous jobs. <br>
      Mss. Crow: Oh, that’s great! Can you tell me how you heard about this position? <br>
      Ms. Brown: Yes, in the first instance, it was rather because of an investigation in the job board. And, because some colleagues with whom I have worked have told me that I must look for an excellent work environment, and I think I could find it here.<br>
      Mss. Crow: What attracted you to our company? <br>
      Ms. Brown: I read that the job involved a lot of organization and interaction with chemical processes. And that there are overtime to practice in the administration area. <br>
      Mss. Crow: Yes, that’s true. linking what you mention, what would you say is your greatest strength? <br>
      Ms. Brown: I am a person who knows how to organize the ideas of different people to make them the same. And I know how to work under pressure, in addition to having an excellent capacity for analysis and observation. <br>
      Mss. Crow: That’s wonderful, and can you tell me how would you handle a situation where your boss or a coworker don’t agree with you in something?<br>
      Ms. Brown: I would first listen to the justification why he or she disagrees with my idea, but I would try to understand his or her opinion as well. And so we will probably come to an agreement.<br>
      Mss. Crow:  What about your biggest weakness?<br>
      Ms. Brown: I think that I’m not too patient and sometimes that things don’t go as I wanted to. <br>
      Mss. Crow: Yes, that can happen. Anyways… do you have any question for me?<br>
      Ms. Brown: Would you call me if you are interested in me, or would it be via mail?<br>
      Mss. Crow: Both, but don’t worry about that. We will call you in the next three days. <br>
      Ms. Brown: Thank you for considering me for the position. Have a nice day!<br>

  <p>
    Mss. Jones: Good morning. Can I help you with something?<br>
    Mr. Miller: Yes, please. I need to cancel one of my accounts, my wallet has been stolen, and it was in there. <br>
    Mss. Jones: Don’t worry Sir, what you can do is to transfer all that money to your remaining account. <br>

    Mss. Jones: Yes Sir, I can help you but the process of transferring will take a bit long, I will be ok if you don’t care too much about the time. <br>

<h2>Seeing the doctor</h2><br>
<p>
  Patient: Hello Doc, I haven’t been feeling well since last week.<br>
  Doctor: Hi! What seems to be the problem? <br>
  Patient: I have been having a lot of pain on my ear and I think I have a bad cough. <br>
  Doctor: Well… That can be a sign that you have a fever, and maybe an infection caused by anything you have eaten or exposed to varies in temperature. Have you gone to any cold place or something like that? <br>
  Patient: Yes, last week I had a trip around Japan, and it was snowing, but I wasn’t wearing a sweater or something because I didn’t expect that. <br>
  Doctor: Ok, let me check your temperature… Oh! It’s too high, your temperature is 39 degrees, you’re too sick. I think I will give you some medicine, take those pills twice a day for five days. And you will need to go with the otolaryngologist.  <br>
  Patient: Doctor… I haven’t tell you something… The point is that I sneeze too. <br>
  Doctor: OK, so… if you have earache, cough, and you sneeze, you have  URI, but don’t worry, I need to add to your prescription another medicine, or to make it faster, would you like injections? <br>
  Patient: Yes, I want that. <br>
  Doctor: Alright, just take the pills, go to emergency and ask for the injections. Oh! don’t forget to schedule the appointment with the otolaryngologist, her name is Wendy. <br>
  Patient: OK doctor. Thank you! And what If I don’t get better? <br>
  Doctor: Come again in here, and I’ll check what’s wrong or what didn’t work. <br>
  Patient: Thanks!
